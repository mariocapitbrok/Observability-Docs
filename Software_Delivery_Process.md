# Software Delivery Process

## 1. **PLAN**

This phase involves understanding business needs, gathering requirements, and defining the scope of the project. Key activities include:

- Stakeholder meetings
- Requirement analysis
- Project roadmap and timelines
- Tool selection and team assignments
- Risk assessment

ðŸ“Œ Goal: Establish a clear, actionable plan aligned with business objectives.

---

## 2. **CODE**

In this phase, developers write the actual software based on the specifications. It includes:

- Writing clean, maintainable code
- Using version control (e.g., Git)
- Following coding standards and style guides
- Conducting peer code reviews

ðŸ“Œ Goal: Translate requirements into functional software components.

---

## 3. **BUILD**

The source code is compiled and converted into executable artifacts. It often involves:

- Dependency resolution
- Compilation and packaging
- Integration of modules
- Build automation using CI tools (e.g., Jenkins, GitHub Actions)

ðŸ“Œ Goal: Create build artifacts ready for testing and deployment.

---

## 4. **TEST**

Automated and manual testing ensures the software works as intended. Common types:

- Unit testing
- Integration testing
- End-to-end testing
- Performance and security testing

ðŸ“Œ Goal: Detect and fix bugs before releasing to production.

---

## 5. **RELEASE**

This phase prepares the software for production by:

- Versioning the build
- Change management approvals
- Creating release notes
- Tagging in version control

ðŸ“Œ Goal: Package and approve software for deployment in a controlled manner.

---

## 6. **DEPLOY**

The approved software is moved to production or staging environments. Key elements:

- Infrastructure provisioning (IaC)
- Blue/Green or Canary deployments
- Rollback strategies
- Use of containers and orchestration (e.g., Docker, Kubernetes)

ðŸ“Œ Goal: Deliver software updates reliably and repeatedly.

---

## 7. **OPERATE**

Focuses on ensuring the application runs smoothly in production. Involves:

- Configuration management
- Incident and problem management
- Ensuring high availability and scalability
- Resource and performance tuning

ðŸ“Œ Goal: Maintain the health and efficiency of the live system.

---

## 8. **MONITOR**

Observability into application and infrastructure through:

- Logging, tracing, and metrics collection
- Alerting and dashboards (e.g., Datadog, Prometheus, Grafana)
- User behavior and error tracking
- SLA/SLO monitoring

ðŸ“Œ Goal: Gain insights to improve performance, reliability, and user experience.
