# 📡 Structured and Actionable Alerting Strategies

This reference document outlines proven strategies for building effective, low-noise alerting systems that promote fast and informed incident response.

---

## 🔔 1. SLO-based Alerting (Service Level Objectives)

- **What**: Alert only when the system is at risk of breaching its reliability goals.
- **How**: Define SLOs (e.g., 99.9% availability) and track error budgets.
- **Actionable**: If you're consuming error budget too quickly, investigate immediately.
- **Tooling**: Prometheus + Error Budget burn rate rules, Google Cloud SLO tooling.

## ⚠️ 2. Multi-level Severity Alerts

- **What**: Classify alerts by impact (Critical, High, Medium, Low).
- **How**:
  - Critical: Paging alert (e.g., total outage)
  - High: Immediate investigation (e.g., partial degradation)
  - Medium: Scheduled investigation (e.g., minor slowdowns)
  - Low: Informational/log-only
- **Actionable**: Each level should come with clear playbook steps.

## 📊 3. Rate-of-change Alerts

- **What**: Trigger alerts when there's a sudden spike or drop in a metric, not just absolute thresholds.
- **How**: Use percentage change over time windows (e.g., 50% increase in errors in 5 minutes).
- **Actionable**: Helps detect anomalies even if metrics are within normal thresholds.

---

## 🧪 4. Symptom-based Alerting

- **What**: Alert on **user-visible** symptoms rather than low-level infrastructure issues.
- **Examples**: Alert if login latency > 1s, not just if CPU usage is > 80%.
- **Actionable**: Prioritizes alerts that affect end-user experience.

---

## 🧭 5. Alert with Context + Runbooks

- **What**: Each alert should include:
  - What happened
  - Impact scope
  - Link to dashboard
  - Link to runbook or SOP
- **Actionable**: Reduces Mean Time To Resolution (MTTR).

---

## 📉 6. Aggregation + Deduplication

- **What**: Group similar alerts (e.g., many 500s from the same service).
- **How**: Use deduplication windows to reduce noise.
- **Actionable**: Prevents alert storms and focuses on root issues.

---

## 📆 7. Time-based Silence and Maintenance Windows

- **What**: Suppress alerts during known maintenance windows or off-hours.
- **Actionable**: Prevents unnecessary noise while ensuring critical alerts still page.

---

## ✅ 8. Alert Testing and Review

- **What**: Regularly test alert rules using synthetic failures or chaos experiments.
- **Actionable**: Validates alert usefulness and reliability.

## 📁 Summary

A good alert is **timely, actionable, and meaningful**. These strategies help ensure alerting systems are useful for engineers, reduce noise, and improve reliability.
